ABOUT
==========================================================================

  Liquidator is an obscure Russian game illegally made using Build Engine and
published in 1998 by Akella Company, who will later make an infamous Postal 3.
The game includes all-new graphics, sounds, and 3 campaigns with total of 6 maps.

game using modern ports. The game is also translated to English and includes
widescreen compatible HUD sprites.

THE STORY
==========================================================================

  As you know, after Professor Silverman created the first teleportation
system in 1993, seekers of adventures rushed into the virtual world.
  However, the unexpected happened. The creatures inhabiting lower realms
of the virtual reality responded with a powerful repulse.
  A number of aggressive-minded groups managed to capture teleportation
devices and, according to the latest information, at the moment are
preparing to capture our reality.
  The Liquidator’s mission is to find fuel depots for the teleportation
devices and destroy them.
  For the duration of this mission, the Liquidator, assigned by the
Worldwide Virtual Teleportation Agency, is endowed with unlimited authority.
